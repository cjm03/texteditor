# texteditor
Simple program for editing text files. Allows for in-text navigation using arrow keys, and all other input modifies the contents of the file with the exception for Ctrl-Q (quit) and Ctrl-S (save).
## Usage
Clone the repo, navigate into it, and run `make`. Default output will be a binary called 'test', so modify the Makefile as desired.
Run using `./test <path/to/file>`.
